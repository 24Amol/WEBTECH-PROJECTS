          Taj Mahal, also spelled Tadj Mahall, mausoleum complex in Agra,
          western Uttar Pradesh state, northern India. The Taj Mahal was built
          by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628–58) to immortalize his
          wife Mumtaz Mahal (“Chosen One of the Palace”), who died in childbirth
          in 1631, having been the emperor’s inseparable companion since their
          marriage in 1612. India’s most famous and widely recognized building,
          it is situated in the eastern part of the city on the southern (right)
          bank of the Yamuna (Jumna) River. Agra Fort (Red Fort), also on the
          right bank of the Yamuna, is about 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the Taj
          Mahal.

            <p>
              Hawa Mahal was built by Kachhwaha Rajput ruler Maharaja Sawai
              Pratap Singh in the year 1799. When the maharaja saw the structure
              of Khetri Mahal in Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan, he was so impressed that
              he decided to build a palace modeled on it. Hawa Mahal, also
              called the Palace of Breeze, was the result of that inspiration.
              This five-storied structure was designed by Lal Chand Ustad as an
              extension of the City Palace. Starting from the City Palace’s
              edge, Hawa Mahal extends to the women’s chambers aka zenana.
              During those days, the Purdah system was strictly followed and
              Royal Rajpur women weren’t allowed to show their face to strangers
              or even appear in public. The palace comprises 953 windows which
              enabled them to get a glimpse of the day-to-day activities and
              festivities happening on the street below without appearing in
              public.

            <p>
              Hawa Mahal, one of the best places to visit in Jaipur, features a
              splendid fusion of Islamic, Mughal, and Rajput architectural
              styles. Its domed canopies, floral patterns, lotus motifs, and
              fluted pillars, all reflect the rich Rajput style. Complementing
              these elements is the filigree work in stone and lavish arches,
              both of which draw influence from the Islamic style of
              architecture. Designed in red and pink sandstone, this
              one-of-its-kind palace boasts of a pyramidal shape. It has five
              stories and rises up to a height of 50 feet. The 953 windows
              featured on the front part of the palace lend it a honeycombed
              hive look. Thanks to the exceptional latticework on these windows,
              the palace experiences a cooling effect as the breeze blows in
              through them. Delicately designed hanging cornices are another
              attractive aspect of Hawa Mahal’s architecture. The interiors of
              the palace consist of pillared chambers and minimally ornamented
              corridors that reach up to the top floor. Patios adorn the front
              part of the first and second floors. Unlike the lower two floors,
              the top three floors have a width that’s not more than a single
              room. There are fountains adorning the center of the building’s
              courtyard.

            <p>The Victoria Memorial, one of the top historical places in Kolkata, is the brainchild of Lord Curzon, a
              Viceroy of India. When Queen Victoria, who was the Empress of British India, died in January 1901, Curzon
              suggested building a grand memorial to honor her. He proposed the memorial to be a stately edifice with a
              museum where visitors get a glimpse of the marvels of the past. The foundation for the memorial was laid on
              4 January 1906 by the Prince of Wales, who later became King George V. The building was formally inaugurated
              and opened for public visits in 1921. Later, additions were made to the memorial after India gained
              independence.</p>

            <p>Located on Queen’s Way, Maidan, Victoria Memorial features Indo-Saracenic revivalist architectural style
              which displays a blend of Mughal and British elements along with Egyptian, Islamic, Venetian, and Deccani
              elements. Made of white Markana marble, the edifice has dimensions of 103 meters by 69 meters and reaches up
              to a height of 56 meters.
  
              In terms of design, Victoria Memorial draws inspiration from the Taj Mahal. It has a main central dome, four
              smaller domes, high portals, domed chaatris of octagonal shape, domed towers at the corners, and terrace.
              The Angel of Victory, a 16-feet tall figure, stands on top of the central dome. You can find several
              allegorical sculptures surrounding the central dome, including Charity, Justice, Art, and Architecture. The
              North Porch has allegorical sculptures of Prudence, Motherhood, and Learning.</p>

            <p>
              The Red Fort was built by none other than the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan to serve as the palace fort for his
              capital Shahjahanabad. He commissioned the construction of the fort by the River Yamuna when he decided to
              shift his capital to Delhi from Agra. The construction, which started in 1638, took over 8 years to
              complete. The structure was originally named Qila-i-Mubarak, which means ‘the Blessed Fort’. During its
              history of over three centuries, the fort saw many occupants, including Aurangzeb, Jahandar Shah, Muhammad
              Shah, and Bahadur Shah II, among others.
  
              The Red Fort underwent massive destruction in 1739 when the Persian ruler Nadir Shan invaded the city and
              plundered the fort of many valuable artifacts, including the Peacock Throne. Later, during the 1857 Revolt
              against the British, the marble structures of the fort were also destroyed.

              The fort, which is spread over 255 acres, features a mix of architectural styles such as Islamic, Hindi,
              Timurid, and Persian. Its massive, 2.5-km-long enclosing walls are made of red sandstone and that’s where
              the monument got its name from. A few parts of the fort are also made of red stone while the remaining
              structure is built using marble. The structure, which is in the shape of an irregular octagon, incorporates
              elements of garden design and also features turrets, bastions, pavilions, two gates, and several other
              sections.

            <p>Today, the Red Fort is one of the top tourist places in Delhi. Every year, the Prime Minister of the
              country hoists the national flag on Independence Day at this historical monument. The PM also delivers a
              speech from its ramparts. In 2007, this iconic edifice was included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage
              Sites in Delhi for its architectural splendor and historical significance. The property is now under the
              control of the Archeological Survey of India.</p>

        Humayun’s Tomb in Delhi is the first-of-its-kind opulent mausoleum built in India and also the first
        garden-tomb in the country. Also known as Maqbara-e-Humayun, this splendid 16th-century monument looks less
        like a tomb and more like a luxurious palace. It is among the best-preserved heritage monuments in Delhi
        that embody Mughal architectural grandeur. If you are planning a trip and booking your hotels in Delhi, make
        sure to include this grand edifice in your itinerary.

          <summary><b>Humayun’s Tomb: History</b></summary>
          <p>This fine mausoleum was built near River Yamuna by Emperor Humayun’s first wife Begum Bega aka Haji Begum
            to immortalize the memory of her husband. Though the Emperor died in 1556, it wasn’t until 1565 that the
            construction for the monument began. After seven years of construction, the tomb and the surrounding
            Charbagh Garden were completed in 1572. Given the grandeur of the memorial, it’s no surprise that the
            construction cost came to 1.5 million rupees, which was completely borne by Begum Bega.

            Over the centuries, Humayun’s Tomb witnessed much neglect and decline. In the 18th-century, the beautiful
            gardens surrounding the monument gave way to vegetable gardens. After the colonial rulers took over Delhi,
            the Charbagh Garden was overlaid with an English-style garden in 1860. However, in the early part of the
            20th-century, the tomb complex was restored with the original gardens at the order of Lord Curzon, the
            then Viceroy of India.

            The monument also played a major role in the modern history of India. At the time of the country’s
            partition in 1947, Humayun’s Tomb along with the Purana Qila served as refugee camps for those migrating
            to Pakistan. For almost five years the camps were held at this site, causing much damage to the main
            structure and the gardens. Later, when the monument came under the control of the Archaeological Survey of
            India, it was once again restored to its original glory.</p>

          <summary><b>Humayun’s Tomb Architecture</b></summary>
          <p>The grand tomb complex was designed by Mirak Mirza Ghiyas, a Persian architect whom the Begum herself
            chose. It is a vivid example of the Mughal style of architecture with elements of Indian and Persians
            styles incorporated into it. The huge tomb with a height of 154 feet and width of 299 feet is mainly built
            in red sandstone while white marble has been used for the double layered dome. Designed as a dynastic
            mausoleum, the structure has 124 small vaulted chambers within its walls.

            Charbagh, the Persian-style garden surrounding the tomb structure, has a quadrilateral layout. It features
            several paved walkways, water channels, a bath chamber, and a pavilion. The walled tomb complex has two
            entrance gateways, one on the south and the other on the west.

          <summary><b>Humayun’s Tomb: Today</b></summary>
          <p>Today, Humayun’s Tomb is one of the best tourist places to visit in Delhi. The whole complex is currently
            run and maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). In 1993, the tomb complex gained the
            status of a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its cultural and historical significance.

            From 2018 onwards, the structure is lit up every evening after sunset for night viewing. The illumination
            is done such that it mimics the effect of moonlight. Though entry to the building is restricted after
            sunset, you can enjoy spell-binding views of the tomb from Nizamuddin Bridge and the flyovers at Zakir
            Hussain Marg and Lodi Road.</p>
