                    Punjabi cuisine is famous all over the country for its delicious flavor. Milk products are an
                    essential part of the cuisine of the state, and hence a glass of Lassi and buttermilk is necessary
                    to every Punjabi meal. Wheat is the staple food of most North Indian people and different dishes
                    made of wheat, such as Aloo Paratha, Makki Roti are also widely consumed. Apart from these,
                    vegetarian dishes such as Rajma Chawal and Kadhi are also extremely adored in the state. The most
                    popular dishes of the state of Punjab include Paneer Tikka, Dal Makhani, among others.

                    The state of Rajasthan is widely known for its distinct variety of dishes. Milk and butter are major
                    parts of the Rajasthani cuisine. Gram flour is also used widely in preparing the dishes. Lentils,
                    beans, corn, millet, among others; form a significant portion of the diet of the people. Dal Bati
                    Churma, Mawa Kachori, Mirchi Bada, and Kalakand are some of the most popular dishes from Rajasthan.

                        <p>
                            Rajasthani cuisine is influenced by its rich heritage and arid climatic conditions. The
                            little availability of fresh fruits and vegetables distinguishes their cuisine. A few common
                            ingredients are beans, lentils, gram flour, corn, barley, millet, bajra, bread and dairy
                            products (esp. Ghee). There is more inclination towards vegetarian food, but various kinds
                            of meat dishes prevail as well.

                    include Aloo Posto and Doi Maach, among others. Bengali sweets are perhaps the most popular desserts

                    Tamil Nadu belongs to the southern part of India and is notable for its delicious food. Tamilian
                    food is mostly vegetarian and includes dishes such As Idli, Vada, Dosa, and Sambar. Rice is the
                    staple of the place. The spicy and tasty blend of the Tamil Nadu cuisine is worth experiencing. The
                    most popular dishes include Uttappam, Takali Soru, Murukku, Paruppu Payasam, among others. Here,
                    people prefer coffee over tea as a beverage. Tamil Nadu is thus home to a unique and distinct
                    cuisine in the country.
